```{r}
tot <- nrow(x)
if (tot < 1000) {
  stmt <- paste("Alright, well, this isn't a large amount of data.",
    "That's good, it won't be overwhelming for you.")
} else {
  stmt <- paste("This is a lot of data. Are you sure you want to load it? Maybe you should look into a Big Data Solution; I can point you in the right direction if you'd like.")
}
cat(stmt)
```

It's really cool that you're working with data, any ways. Not a lot of people like you do! Let's look at a tiny bit of it, yeah?

```{r}
print(head(x))
```

Wow, that's some impressive data! Maybe you'll do something great with it! 
(If not, don't worry. We don't have high expectations.)
